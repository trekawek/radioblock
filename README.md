# RadioBlock

AdBlock for the polish public radio [Tr贸jka](http://www.polskieradio.pl/9,Trojka). Uses cross correlation to find ad jingles and mutes the whole ads block. More info can be found in a blog post: [part 1](http://blog.rekawek.eu/2016/02/24/radio-adblock/), [part 2](http://blog.rekawek.eu/2016/02/27/radio-adblock-2/).

## Usage

### Building

The project can be build with:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Case 1 - detecting ads

The analyzer modules is a CLI application reading the stream from the standard input and trying to find the configured samples. For instance, the command below uses ffmpeg to generate the raw stream of Polish "Tr贸jka" and looks for the commercial start and stop jingles, with thresholds 500 and 700, respectively. The "2" describes the channel count:

```bash
cd analyzer
ffmpeg -loglevel -8 \
       -i http://stream3.polskieradio.pl:8904/\;stream \
       -f s16le -acodec pcm_s16le - \
  | java -jar target/analyzer-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    2 \
    src/test/resources/commercial-start-44.1k.raw 500 \
    src/test/resources/commercial-end-44.1k.raw 700
```

Another example - reading the audio stream from the RTL-SDR device:

```bash
rtl_fm -M wbfm -f 89.50M -g 0 \
 | java -jar analyzer-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar 1 \
   commercial-start-32k-mono.raw 180 \
   commercial-end-32k-mono.raw 190 \
```

### Case 2 - GUI

A standalone "Tr贸jka" player with GUI:

```bash
java -jar standalone/target/standalone-*.jar
```

### Case 3 - write the muted stream to stdout

A command line "Tr贸jka" player, passing the stream to stdout. Output format is PCM, 48000, stereo, low-endian. Example:

```bash
java -jar standalone/target/standalone-*.jar --cli 500 700 \
  | play -t raw -b 16 -c 2 -r 48000 -e signed-integer -
```

### Case 4 - Icecast with Docker

An Icecast server streaming the radio broadcast, with ads muted.

```bash
cd standalone
docker-compose up --build 
```

The broadcast will be available at http://localhost:8000/
