        <!-- input module

            The module used here is the playlist module - it has
            'submodules' for different types of playlist. There are
            two currently implemented, 'basic', which is a simple
            file-based playlist, and 'script' which invokes a command
            to returns a filename to start playing. -->

        <!-- Stream instance
    You may have one or more instances here. This allows you to
    send the same input data to one or more servers (or to different
    mountpoints on the same server). Each of them can have different
    parameters. This is primarily useful for a) relaying to multiple
    independent servers, and b) encoding/reencoding to multiple
    bitrates.
    If one instance fails (for example, the associated server goes
    down, etc), the others will continue to function correctly.
    This example defines two instances as two mountpoints on the
    same server.  -->

            <!-- Server details:
                You define hostname and port for the server here, along with

                When something goes wrong (e.g. the server crashes, or the
                network drops) and ices disconnects from the server, these
                control how often it tries to reconnect, and how many times
                it tries to reconnect. Delay is in seconds.
                If you set reconnectattempts to -1, it will continue
                indefinately. Suggest setting reconnectdelay to a large value
                if you do this.

            <!-- maxqueuelength:
                This describes how long the internal data queues may be. This
                basically lets you control how much data gets buffered before
                ices decides it can't send to the server fast enough, and
                either shuts down or flushes the queue (dropping the data)
                and continues.
                For advanced users only.
